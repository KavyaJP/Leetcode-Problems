# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions!  
This repository is where I organize every problem I've solved—clean code, consistent structure, and notes that help me (and maybe you) understand the thought process behind each approach.

## About This Repository

This repo serves as:

- **My personal archive** of all LeetCode problems I've solved.
- **A way to track my progress** across topics and difficulty levels.
- **A learning reference**, with clear solutions written for readability.
- **A practice ground** for improving problem-solving and coding patterns.

Each solution includes:

- **Clean, well-structured code**
- **Problem name & number**
- **Time and space complexity**
- **Optional notes or explanations** (when something tricky is involved)

## Repository Structure

Structure may vary based on the style I stick to, but in general:

- **Each folder = one category**
- **Each file = one LeetCode problem**
- Filenames follow:  
  `problem-number_problem-title.ext`  
  (Example: `001_two-sum.cpp`)

## Languages Used

Depending on the problem, I may solve solutions in:

- **C++** (main)
- **Python**
- **Java**

## Progress Tracking

I’ll keep updating this repo regularly as I solve more problems.

| Difficulty | Solved |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Easy       | 1      |
| Medium     | 2      |
| Hard       |        |

(These will update over time.)
